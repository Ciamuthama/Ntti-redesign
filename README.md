## Description

🌍 Welcome to the Nairobi TTI Website Redesign project! This project aims to improve the overall structure and layout of the Nairobi TTI college website, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. I embarked on this endeavor to showcase my skills and create a better online experience for the college community.

## Problems Encountered

🔧 The main challenge faced during this project was implementing two navigation menus. The top navigation had to disappear once a user started scrolling, but I wasn't using Bootstrap, which provides an easy solution with the Affix component. However, I managed to find an old jQuery code snippet and successfully converted it to Vanilla JavaScript. This allowed me to integrate the functionality seamlessly into the project.

## Features

✨ The redesigned Nairobi TTI website offers the following features:

- 🏢 A clean and modern user interface that enhances the overall user experience.
- 📱 Responsiveness across different devices, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- 🌐 Streamlined navigation that adapts to the user's behavior, making it intuitive and user-friendly.
- 🌈 Thoughtful color scheme and typography choices for improved readability and visual appeal.
- 📅 Up-to-date news and announcements to keep students, staff, and visitors informed.
